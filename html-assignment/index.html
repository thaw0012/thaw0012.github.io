        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Heidy Thaw. I was born in Thailand but raised in Canada my whole life. My ethnicity is <em>Karen</em> which is an ethnic group in Thailand and Myanmar. My hobbies include crocheting drawing, and watching anime. My New Year's resolution is to return to the gym this year. I would like to be more active to benefit my health. A fun fact about me is I have been a licensed lash technician since June 16<sup>th</sup>, 2021.
        </p>
         <p>
            I chose the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program because I wanted to incorporate my passion for art with digital marketing. I enjoy finding new ways to express my creativity. I believe technology will continue to be integrated into society therefore building skill sets around it will add value to future jobs.
