        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>My name is Heidy Thaw. I was born in Thailand but raised in Canada my whole life. My ethnicity is Karen which is an ethnic group in Thailand and Myanmar. My hobbies include crocheting drawing, and watching anime. My New Year's resolution is to return to the gym this year. I would like to be more active to benefit my health. A fun fact about me is I have been a licensed lash technician since 2021. 
    
         I chose the interactive media program because I wanted to incorporate my passion for art with digital marketing. I enjoy finding new ways to express my creativity. I believe technology will continue to be integrated into society therefore building skill sets around it will add value to future jobs.
